Task-scheduler for Java that was inspired by the need for a clustered `java.util.concurrent.ScheduledExecutorService` simpler than Quartz.

As such, also appreciated by users ([cbarbosa2](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/issues/115#issuecomment-649601944), [rafaelhofmann](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/issues/140#issuecomment-704955500)):

## Features

* **Cluster-friendly**. Guarantees execution by single scheduler instance.
* **Persistent** tasks. Requires single database-table for persistence.
* **Embeddable**. Built to be embedded in existing applications.
* **Simple**.
* **Minimal dependencies**. (slf4j)

## Getting started

1. Add maven dependency
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.kagkarlsson</groupId>
    <artifactId>db-scheduler</artifactId>
    <version>9.3</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Create the `scheduled_tasks` table in your database-schema. See table definition for [postgresql](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/postgresql_tables.sql), [oracle](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/oracle_tables.sql), [mssql](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/mssql_tables.sql) or [mysql](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/mysql_tables.sql).

3. Instantiate and start the scheduler, which then will start any defined recurring tasks.

```java
RecurringTask<Void> hourlyTask = Tasks.recurring("my-hourly-task", FixedDelay.ofHours(1))
        .execute((inst, ctx) -> {
            System.out.println("Executed!");
        });

final Scheduler scheduler = Scheduler
        .create(dataSource)
        .startTasks(hourlyTask)
        .threads(5)
        .build();

// hourlyTask is automatically scheduled on startup if not already started (i.e. exists in the db)
scheduler.start();
```

For more examples, continue reading. For details on the inner workings, see [How it works](#how-it-works). If you have a Spring Boot application, have a look at [Spring Boot Usage](#spring-boot-usage).

## Examples

### Recurring task

Define a _recurring_ task and schedule the task's first execution on start-up using the `startTasks` builder-method. Upon completion, the task will be re-scheduled according to the defined schedule (see [pre-defined schedule-types](#schedules)).

```java
RecurringTask<Void> hourlyTask = Tasks.recurring("my-hourly-task", FixedDelay.ofHours(1))
        .execute((inst, ctx) -> {
            System.out.println("Executed!");
        });

final Scheduler scheduler = Scheduler
        .create(dataSource)
        .startTasks(hourlyTask)
        .threads(5)
        .build();

// hourlyTask is automatically scheduled on startup if not already started (i.e. exists in the db)
scheduler.start();
```


###  One-time tasks

An instance of a _one-time_ task has a single execution-time some time in the future (i.e. non-recurring). The instance-id must be unique within this task, and may be used to encode some metadata (e.g. an id). For more complex state, custom serializable java objects are supported (as used in the example).

Define a _one-time_ task and start the scheduler:

```java
OneTimeTask<MyTaskData> myAdhocTask = Tasks.oneTime("my-typed-adhoc-task", MyTaskData.class)
        .execute((inst, ctx) -> {
            System.out.println("Executed! Custom data, Id: " + inst.getData().id);
        });

final Scheduler scheduler = Scheduler
        .create(dataSource, myAdhocTask)
        .threads(5)
        .build();

scheduler.start();

```

... and then at some point (at runtime), an execution is scheduled using the `SchedulerClient`:

```java
// Schedule the task for execution a certain time in the future and optionally provide custom data for the execution
scheduler.schedule(myAdhocTask.instance("1045", new MyTaskData(1001L)), Instant.now().plusSeconds(5));
```


### Proper shutdown of the scheduler

To avoid unnecessary [dead exexutions](#dead-executions), it is important to shutdown the scheduler properly, i.e. calling the `shutdown` method.

```java

final Scheduler scheduler = Scheduler
        .create(dataSource, myAdhocTask)
        .build();

Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        LOG.info("Received shutdown signal.");
        scheduler.stop();
    }
});

scheduler.start();
```

## Configuration

### Scheduler configuration

The scheduler is created using the `Scheduler.create(...)` builder. The builder have sensible defaults, but the following options are configurable.

| Option  | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| `.threads(int)`  | 10  | Number of threads |
| `.pollingInterval(Duration)`  |  30s  | How often the scheduler checks the database for due executions. |
| `.pollingLimit(int)`  |  3 * `<nr-of-threads>`  | Maximum number of executions to fetch on a check for due executions. |
| `.heartbeatInterval(Duration)`  | 5m | How often to update the heartbeat timestamp for running executions. |
| `.schedulerName(SchedulerName)`  | hostname  | Name of this scheduler-instance. The name is stored in the database when an execution is picked by a scheduler. |
| `.tableName(String)`  | `scheduled_tasks` | Name of the table used to track task-executions. Change name in the table definitions accordingly when creating the table. |
| `.serializer(Serializer)`  | standard Java | Serializer implementation to use when serializing task data. |
| `.enableImmediateExecution()`  | false | If this is enabled, the scheduler will attempt to directly execute tasks that are scheduled to `now()`, or a time in the past. For this to work, the call to `schedule(..)` must not occur from within a transaction, because the record will not yet be visible to the scheduler (if this is a requirement, see the method `scheduler.triggerCheckForDueExecutions()`) |
| `.executorService(ExecutorService)`  | `null`  | If specified, use this externally managed executor service to run executions. Ideally the number of threads it will use should still be supplied (for scheduler polling optimizations). |
| `shutdownMaxWait(Duration)`  | `30min`  | How long the scheduler will wait before interrupting executor-service threads. If you find yourself using this, consider if it is possible to instead regularly check `executionContext.getSchedulerState().isShuttingDown()` in the ExecutionHandler and abort long-running task. |
| `.deleteUnresolvedAfter(Duration)`  | `14d`  | The time after which executions with unknown tasks are automatically deleted. These can typically be old recurring tasks that are not in use anymore. This is non-zero to prevent accidental removal of tasks through a configuration error (missing known-tasks) and problems during rolling upgrades. |
| `.jdbcCustomization(JdbcCustomization)`  | auto  | db-scheduler tries to auto-detect the database used to see if any jdbc-interactions need to be customized. This method is an escape-hatch to allow for setting `JdbcCustomizations` explicitly. |
| `.commitWhenAutocommitDisabled(boolean)`  | false  | By default no commit is issued on DataSource Connections. If auto-commit is disabled, it is assumed that transactions are handled by an external transaction-manager. Set this property to `true` to override this behavior and have the Scheduler always issue commits. |



### Task configuration

Tasks are created using one of the builder-classes in `Tasks`. The builders have sensible defaults, but the following options can be overridden.

| Option  | Default | Description |
| ------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| `.onFailure(FailureHandler)`  | see desc.  | What to do when a `ExecutionHandler` throws an exception. By default, _Recurring tasks_ are rescheduled according to their `Schedule` _one-time tasks_ are retried again in 5m. |
| `.onDeadExecution(DeadExecutionHandler)`  | `ReviveDeadExecution`  | What to do when a _dead executions_ is detected, i.e. an execution with a stale heartbeat timestamp. By default dead executions are rescheduled to `now()`. |
| `.initialData(T initialData)`  | `null`  | The data to use the first time a _recurring task_ is scheduled. |


### Schedules

The library contains a number of Schedule-implementations for recurring tasks. See class `Schedules`.

| Schedule  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `.daily(LocalTime ...)`  | Runs every day at specified times. Optionally a time zone can be specified. |
| `.fixedDelay(Duration)`  | Next execution-time is `Duration` after last completed execution. **Note:** This `Schedule` schedules the initial execution to `Instant.now()` when used in `startTasks(...)`|
| `.cron(String)`  | Spring-style cron-expression. |

Another option to configure schedules is reading string patterns with `Schedules.parse(String)`.

The currently available patterns are:

| Pattern  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `FIXED_DELAY\|Ns`  | Same as `.fixedDelay(Duration)` with duration set to N seconds. |
| `DAILY\|12:30,15:30...(\|time_zone)`  | Same as `.daily(LocalTime)` with optional time zone (e.g. Europe/Rome, UTC)|

More details on the time zone formats can be found [here](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/time/ZoneId.html#of-java.lang.String-).

## Spring Boot usage

For Spring Boot applications, there is a starter `db-scheduler-spring-boot-starter` making the scheduler-wiring very simple. (See [full example project](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/tree/master/examples/spring-boot-example)).

### Prerequisites

- An existing Spring Boot application
- A working `DataSource` with schema initialized. (In the example HSQLDB is used and schema is automatically applied.)

### Getting started

1. Add the following Maven dependency
    ```xml
    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.kagkarlsson</groupId>
        <artifactId>db-scheduler-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
        <version>9.3</version>
    </dependency>
    ```
   **NOTE**: This includes the db-scheduler dependency itself.
2. In your configuration, expose your `Task`'s as Spring beans. If they are recurring, they will automatically be picked up and started.
3. If you want to expose `Scheduler` state into actuator health information you need to enable `db-scheduler` health indicator. [Spring Health Information.](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/production-ready-features.html#production-ready-health)
4. Run the app.

### Configuration options

Configuration is mainly done via `application.properties`. Configuration of scheduler-name, serializer and executor-service is done by adding a bean of type `DbSchedulerCustomizer` to your Spring context.

```
# application.properties example showing default values

db-scheduler.enabled=true
db-scheduler.heartbeat-interval=5m
db-scheduler.polling-interval=10s
db-scheduler.polling-limit=
db-scheduler.table-name=scheduled_tasks
db-scheduler.immediate-execution-enabled=false
db-scheduler.scheduler-name=
db-scheduler.threads=10
# Ignored if a custom DbSchedulerStarter bean is defined
db-scheduler.delay-startup-until-context-ready=false
```

## Interacting with scheduled executions using the SchedulerClient

TODO

## How it works

A single database table is used to track future task-executions. When a task-execution is due, db-scheduler picks it and executes it. When the execution is done, the `Task` is consulted to see what should be done. For example, a `RecurringTask` is typically rescheduled in the future based on its `Schedule`.

Optimistic locking is used to guarantee that a one and only one scheduler-instance gets to pick a task-execution.


### Recurring tasks

The term _recurring task_ is used for tasks that should be run regularly, according to some schedule (see ``Tasks.recurring(..)``).

When the execution of a recurring task has finished, a `Schedule` is consulted to determine what the next time for
execution should be, and a future task-execution is created for that time (i.e. it is _rescheduled_).
The time chosen will be the nearest time according to the `Schedule`, but still in the future.

To create the initial execution for a `RecurringTask`, the scheduler has a method `startTasks(...)` that takes a list of tasks
that should be "started" if they do not already have an existing execution. The initial execution-time is determined by the `Schedule`.
If the task already has a future execution (i.e. has been started at least once before), but an updated `Schedule` now indicates another execution-time,
the existing execution will be rescheduled to the new execution-time (with the exception of _non-deterministic_ schedules
such as `FixedDelay` where new execution-time is further into the future).

### One-time tasks

The term _one-time task_ is used for tasks that have a single execution-time (see `Tasks.oneTime(..)`).
In addition to encode data into the `instanceId`of a task-execution, it is possible to store arbitrary binary data in a separate field for use at execution-time. By default, Java serialization is used to marshal/unmarshal the data.

### Custom tasks

For tasks not fitting the above categories, it is possible to fully customize the behavior of the tasks using `Tasks.custom(..)`.

Use-cases might be:

* Recurring tasks that needs to update its data
* Tasks that should be either rescheduled or removed based on output from the actual execution


### Dead executions

During execution, the scheduler regularly updates a heartbeat-time for the task-execution. If an execution is marked as executing, but is not receiving updates to the heartbeat-time, it will be considered a _dead execution_ after time X. That may for example happen if the JVM running the scheduler suddenly exits.

When a dead execution is found, the `Task`is consulted to see what should be done. A dead `RecurringTask` is typically rescheduled to `now()`.


### Things to note / gotchas

* There are no guarantees that all instants in a schedule for a `RecurringTask` will be executed. The `Schedule` is consulted after the previous task-execution finishes, and the closest time in the future will be selected for next execution-time. A new type of task may be added in the future to provide such functionality.

* The methods on `SchedulerClient` (`schedule`, `cancel`, `reschedule`) and the `CompletionHandler` will run using a new `Connection`from the `DataSource`provided. To have the action be a part of a transaction, it must be taken care of by the `DataSource`provided, for example using something like Spring's `TransactionAwareDataSourceProxy`.

* Currently, the precision of db-scheduler is depending on the `pollingInterval` (default 10s) which specifies how often to look in the table for due executions. If you know what you are doing, the scheduler may be instructed at runtime to "look early" via `scheduler.triggerCheckForDueExecutions()`. (See also `enableImmediateExecution()` on the `Builder`)


## Versions / upgrading

See [releases](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/releases) for release-notes.

**Upgrading to 8.x**
* Custom Schedules must implement a method `boolean isDeterministic()` to indicate whether they will always produce the same instants or not.

**Upgrading to 4.x**
* Add column `consecutive_failures` to the database schema. See table definitions for [postgresql](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/postgresql_tables.sql), [oracle](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/src/test/resources/oracle_tables.sql) or [mysql](https://github.com/kagkarlsson/db-scheduler/src/test/resources/mysql_tables.sql). `null` is handled as 0, so no need to update existing records.

**Upgrading to 3.x**
* No schema changes
* Task creation are preferrably done through builders in `Tasks` class

**Upgrading to 2.x**
* Add column `task_data` to the database schema. See table definitions for [postgresql](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/postgresql_tables.sql), [oracle](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/oracle_tables.sql) or [mysql](db-scheduler/src/test/resources/mysql_tables.sql).

## FAQ

#### Why `db-scheduler` when there is `Quartz`?

The goal of `db-scheduler` is to be non-invasive and simple to use, but still solve the persistence problem, and the cluster-coordination problem.
 It was originally targeted at applications with modest database schemas, to which adding 11 tables would feel a bit overkill..

#### Why use a RDBMS for persistence and coordination?

KISS. It's the most common type of shared state applications have.

#### I am missing feature X?

Please create an issue with the feature request and we can discuss it there.
If you are impatient (or feel like contributing), pull requests are most welcome :)

#### Is anybody using it?

Yes. It is used in production at a number of companies, and have so far run smoothly.
